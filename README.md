```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

bundle exec rails g spree_fedex_crossborder:install
```

Setup/Configuration
-------------------

Requires `FEDEX_CROSSBORDER_PARTNER_KEY` environment value to be set.

Requires `config.fedex_crossborder_exchange_rate_url = 'https://partnertools.bongous.com/currency/exchanges.json?key='` setting in config/application.rb .

Requires a scheduled task on server to execute `update_exchange_rates` once a day.

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:
